/*
Definition : Evaluation of an expression may produce side effects. For an example : 

like in the undefinedExample1() , the evaluation order matters the consequence. It is compiler and OS dependent because there is no defined calling order of functions. 

like in the undefinedExample2() , the return value is ambiguous because what evaluated first and how it evaluated effects the consequence. consequence can be 100 or 121. 

Unlike above cases, at certain specified points in the execution sequence called sequence points, all side effects of previous evaluations are guaranteed to be complete. A sequence point defines any point in a computer programâ€™s execution at which it is guaranteed that all side effects of previous evaluations will have been performed, and no side effects from subsequent evaluations have yet been performed.
