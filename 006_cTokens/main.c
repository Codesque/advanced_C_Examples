External Variables are also known as global variables. These variables are defined outside of the function. These variables are available globally throughout the function execution.

*`Extern` keyword is used to extend visibility of function or variable.
*Variables with `extern` keyword are only declared not defined.BUT WHAT IS DECLARATION ? WHAT IS DEFINITION ? 

        * Declaration means implying to the program that this or that function will exist. This situation plays an important role because 
        it identfies what the variable/function datatype is going to be.  It also tell the arguments , return types and other data types 
        to the program. 

        :::::::::::::::::>>>> Declaration does not allocate the memory. 

        * Definition means declaring the function and allocating memory for that function/variable. So we can think declaration as 
        the subset of definition. ( Because definition = declaration + allocatingMemory :::: definition is bigger) 


        

        SCOPE           ------> They are not bound by any function. They are everywhere in the program i.e global.
        DEFAULT VALUE   ------> Default initialized value of global variables are 0. 
        LIFETIME        ------> Till the end of the execution of the program.  

*WORTH TO MENTION : 
-------->>  When extern is used with a variable, itâ€™s only declared, not defined.
-------->>  As an exception, when an extern variable is declared with initialization, it is taken as the definition of the variable as well.

Registering is faster way to access variables without allocating the memory. You can put your variables in your register instead of your memory

Structure keyword are used for grouping literal datatypes into a single type.

    * The C structs doesnt allow us to determine our datatype as built-in.

    * STATIC MEMBERS : C Structures can not have static members inside their body. 
    * ACCESS MODIFIERS : C programming language do not support access modifiers. 
    * CONSTRUCTION CREATION IN STRUCTURE : C Structures can not have Constructor inside of themselves.
